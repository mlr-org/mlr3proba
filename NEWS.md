# mlr3proba dev

* fix: allow cloning of measures objects

# mlr3proba 0.7.4

* fix + update `MeasureSurv`: survival measure labels are now printed and the `obs_loss` property is now supported
* feat: add `na.rm` parameter to `msr("surv.calib_index")` to avoid `NaN` scores

# mlr3proba 0.7.3

* feat: added new calibration measure => `msr("surv.calib_index")`
* refactor + feat: `autoplot.PredictionSurv`
  * The default `"calib"` plot uses the survival matrix directly now which is faster
  * `"dcalib"` has extra barplot + better documentation
  * Added new `type = "scalib"` which constructs the smoothed calibration plots as in Austin et al. (2020)
  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: `"preds"` is now called `"isd"` (individual survival distribution). `row_ids` can now be used to filter the observations for which you draw the survival curves.

# mlr3proba 0.7.2

* fix: `lrn("surv.coxph")` is now trained with `model=TRUE` which fixes an issue with using observation weights [stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79297386/mlr3-predicted-values-for-surv-coxph-learner-with-case-weights).
* cleanup: remove `tsk("unemployment")` and associated files
* cleanup: remove unused references

# mlr3proba 0.7.1

* cleanup: removed all `PipeOp`s and pipelines related to survival => regression reduction techniques (see #414)
* fix: `$predict_type` of `survtoclassif_disctime` and `survtoclassif_IPCW` was `prob` (classification type) and not `crank` (survival type)
* fix: G(t) is not filtered when `t_max|p_max` is specified in scoring rules (didn't influence evaluation at all)
* docs: Clarified the use and impact of using `t_max` in scoring rules, added examples in scoring rules and AUC scores
* feat: Added new argument `remove_obs` in scoring rules to remove observations with observed time `t > t_max` as a processing step to alleviate IPCW issues.
This was before 'hard-coded' which made the Integrated Brier Score (`msr("surv.graf")`) differ minimally from other implementations and the original definition.

# mlr3proba 0.4.8

* Measures now use parameter sets like learners. This streamlines the interface but unfortunately means ids can no longer be set dynamically.
* Add parameters `t_max` and `p_max` to Graf, Schmid and Integrated Log-loss as an alternative to `times`. `t_max` is equivalent to `times = seq(t_max)` and `p_max` is the proportion of censoring to integrate up to in the dataset.
* Fix bug in Rcpp code that was causing erroneous values for calculating the cindex in datasets greater than 20,000 observations.

# mlr3proba 0.4.2

* Patch for linux

# mlr3proba 0.4.1

* Remove `mlr3extralearners` from Suggests
* Add `response` to `as_prediction_surv`
* Now exported a couple cpp functions and `assert_surv`
* `mlr3` is now in `Depends` not `imports`
* `distr` predictions are now internally stored as matrices to significantly reduce prediction object sizes
* Tasks now support strata property

# mlr3proba 0.4.0

* Deprecated measures from 0.2.0 have now been deleted.
* IPCW measures such as `surv.graf`, `surv.schmid`, and `surv.intlogloss` now allow training data to be passed to the score function with `task` and `train_set` to allow the censoring distribution to be estimated on the training data. This is automatically applied for resample and benchmark results.
* IPCW measures such as `surv.graf`, `surv.schmid`, and `surv.intlogloss` now include a parameter `proper` to determine what weighting scheme should be applied by the estimated censoring distribution, The current method (Graf, 1999) `proper = FALSE`, weights observations either by their event time or 'current' time depending if they're dead or not, the new method `proper = TRUE` weights observations by event time. The `proper = TRUE` method is strictly proper when censoring and survival times are independent and G is estimated on large enough data. The `proper = FALSE` method is never proper. The default is currently `proper = FALSE` to enable backward compatibility, this will be changed to `proper = TRUE` in v0.6.0.
* The `rm_cens` parameter in `surv.logloss` has been deprecated in favour of `IPCW`. `rm_cens` will be removed in v0.6.0. If `rm_cens` or `IPCW` are `TRUE` then censored observations are removed and the score is weighted by an estimate of the censoring distribution at individual event times. Otherwise if `rm_cens` and `IPCW` are `FALSE` then no deletion or weighting takes place. The `IPCW = TRUE` method is strictly proper when censoring and survival times are independent and G is estimated on large enough data. The `ipcw = FALSE` method is never proper.
* Add `surv.dcalib` for the D-Calibration measure from Haider et al. (2020).

# mlr3proba 0.3.2

* Patched bug causing ``"interval2"`` task type not to work
* Fixed bug causing pipelines not to function correctly in `$aggregate`

# mlr3proba 0.3.1

* Reverted removal of `"interval2"`

# mlr3proba 0.3.0

* Commonly used survival quantities have been added as active bindings to `TaskSurv` including `times` (observed survival times), `status` (observed survival indicator), `unique_times` (set of sorted unique outcome times), `unique_event_times` (set of sorted unique failure times), `risk_set` (set of observations alive 'just before' a given time)
* `"interval2"` censoring type has been removed from `TaskSurv` as this is covered by the other types
* Default values have now been given to the `time` and `event` arguments in `TaskSurv`
* `PredictionDens` can now include `distr` return type (equivalent to `learner$model`)

# mlr3proba 0.2.6

* Minor internal fixes

# mlr3proba 0.2.5

* `PipeOpCrankCompositor` updated to fix bottleneck in computation via `mean`. Now `Inf` or `NA` is replaced by `0` for `response` and imputed with the median for `crank`
* Bug in `distr` predict types fixed that lead to fitting degenerate distributions and returning incorrect values for mean survival time and `crank`

# mlr3proba 0.2.4

* CRITICAL BUG FIX - `compose_crank` was previously returning ranks with the reverse ordering so that higher ranks implied higher risk not lower.

# mlr3proba 0.2.3

* All learners that previously lived in the mlr3learners organisation are now in the [mlr3extralearners](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3extralearners) repository.
* Fixed bottleneck in `MeasureSurvLogloss`
* Bugfix in `MeasureSurvCalibrationAlpha`
* Patch for valgrind
* `TaskDens` now inherits from `TaskUnsupervised` which means `target`/`truth` has been removed. No specification of a `target` column is required, instead a one-column matrix-like object or numeric vector should be passed to the task `backend` and the density will be estimated for this column, or two columns and one set as `weight`.
* Fixed bug in  `load_eruption` to fix name of data columns
* Added calibration plot for comparing average predicted survival distribution to Kaplan-Meier to [mlr3viz](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3viz)
* Removed unneccessary `pracma` dependency in learners
* Fix in `PipeOpDistrCompositor`, previously base distribution was only using the first predicted distribution, now the baseline is taken by averaging over all predictions with uniform weights

# mlr3proba 0.2.2

* Default kernel for `LearnerDensityKDE` is now `Epan` to reduce imports
* Minor internal patches for mlr3 0.6.0
* Bug fix in `MeasureSurvCalibrationBeta` now returns `NA` not error if `lp` predict type not available

# mlr3proba 0.2.1

* Removed `PredictionRegr` causing masking issues with `{mlr3}`
* Bug fix in `PipeOpDistrCompositor` causing some `cdf` predictions to be lost
* Internal fixes for `mlr3pipelines`: public train and predict methods to private

* Add `overwrite` to `crankcompositor` pipeop and pipeline
